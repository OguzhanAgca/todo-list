### ToDo List

- This is my first real project with JavaScript and [JSON-Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server).
- I used JavaScript (ES5 - ES6 - ES7), Bootstrap, HTML and some Font-Awesome and CSS in this project.
- I didn't want to use LocalStorage because i wanted to practice with Fake Rest Api.
- I would be very happy if you would tell me your suggestions and my mistakes.
- I added a "Delete All" button, but I couldn't make it compatible with the JSON-Server module. So i deleted it.
